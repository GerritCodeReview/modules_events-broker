I think this is breaking the class responsibility because it is introducing that logic. We should move it to the StreamEventPublisher class and use something similar to com.googlesource.gerrit.plugins.multisite.forwarder.events.EventTopic where we already have STREAM_EVENT_TOPIC(\"GERRIT.EVENT.STREAM\", \"streamEvent\"); topic configuration whit is resolved from the config:\n public String topic(Configuration config) {\n    return config.broker().getTopic(topicAliasKey(), topic);\n  }",

      "message": "mmm, good point @marcin, thanks for pointing it out.\n\nI am not that familiar with that part of the multi-site logic, and I am trying to understand how the approach fits here.\n\nIn the example you provided we read from the multi-site configuration, so that\u0027s fine. If I understand your suggestion however, the events-broker (which does not have any configuration) will need to read the name of the topic from different configuration files or sections. (i.e. events-aws-kinesis, events-kafka), provided by the consumer.\n\nDid I get your suggestion right?",
