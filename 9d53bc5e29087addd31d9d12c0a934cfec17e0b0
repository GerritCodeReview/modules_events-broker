      "message": "Note that the old implementation treated a TimeoutException as something that justifies incrementing the broker-failed-to-publish-metric. To me this is debatable as the future might still succeed in publishing the message and we have just incremented the wrong metric. But while I don\u0027t necessarily agree with the semantics and the implementation here, I kept the old behaviour as I assume it was reviewed back at the time and agreed this is what we want to do.",

      "message": "as mentioned in the description, note that the logic on whether to publish a stream event is slightly different between this class and multi-site\u0027s `BrokerApiWrapper`: in the former, the event is published if both the node instance id and the event\u0027s instance id are null. For the latter though, a null instance id is treated as a signal to skip the message. I flagged this during the kick off and the suggestion was to keep the logic from multi-site.",
